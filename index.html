          <h2>Correlation Discovered Between Obesity and Smoking</h2>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A recent survey of smokers, conducted by researchers at Gray University, across all 50 states discovered, unsurprisingly a strong 
            correlation between higher levels of obesity in smokers. The survey results, which are grouped by 
            states, allowed researchers to get a firm grasp upon which regions, and specifically which states, are suffering from an epidemic of 
            unhealthy habits leading to unhealthy lifestyles.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Southern and midwestern states fared the worst in the survey. Arkansas, West Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi,
            Lousiana, Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio all reported that nearly half of those states' residents are smokers and
            better than 30 percent are characterized as obese. States with the lowest combined percentages of smokers and obese 
            residents were led by western and northeastern states including Hawaii, California, Utah, Massachusetts and Vermont.
            Reseachers were surprised to find the District of Columbia also fared well in the study.
          </p>
          <p>The findings raise questions about the influence culture and political leanings play on healthy and unhealth lifestyles. In general, 
            politically conservative states fared poorer than left-leaning states.
