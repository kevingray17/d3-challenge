**d3 Challenge**

**Hypothesis**
Working under the hypothesis that smokers generally don't live healthy lifestyles, I worked to determine whether a strong correlation existed between smokers and obesity. 

**Scope of Project**
1. First, I acquired an extensive data set of health characteristics broken down by state that would be used to bolster or weaker the state hypothesis.
1. Using d3 js, I created a scatterplot with obesity percentage on the x-axis and a y-axis representing a state's percentage of smokers.
1. Upon the creation of this scatterplot, I looked closely at the data to determine the strength of correlation between these two factors and included my findings in an article attached to the scatterplot document.

**Further Questions for Consideration**
There were strong suggestions from the data that regional and cultural influences, may influence the propensity to lead a healthy or unhealthy lifestyle. The following questions may be worthy of further study:

1. Does education level affect overall health?
1. Is there a correlation between political leanings of a state and the level of healthiness in that state?
